Denver has continously aim to reduce time and automate tasks performed by desktop team on a daily basis. He has developed automation tools for thin clients, virtual machines and desktops which saves us hundreds of hours of manual work.

The following are a few examples:

- Batch ActiveView and Global Corporate Directory Query which effectively and efficiently queries user information quickly and easily.  Because of this tool, we were able to automate the creation of our month-end reports and user inventory.

- Thin Client Session Info which identifies the most recent Virtual Desktop host and user login information. This allows us to easily determine which user is using a thin client host. This has also improved our device management capability and hardware inventory. Knowing this information is crucial in providing timely support for our users.

- Disk Write Protection Enabler which allows us to disable or enable disk protection on-demand for all applicable devices on an on-demand basis.

- Desktop Language GUI Changer which allows us to change user interface language based on users preference
